# Mish-mash

Mish-mash is a programming languague that will probably never make sense to anyone. The point of this repo is to learn C, assemply and compiler design.

## Behind the name

My first CS teacher didn't speak much English and pronounced the "Type Mismatch" error from Turbo Pascal as "Type Mish-mash". 13-year-old me found this extremely funny. Current me still chuckles a bit. The syntax is based on most of what I remember from Pascal, which is very little. I haven't looked at Pascal since then and I don't plan to start any time soon.
